The mode bound to an Indico event allows you to book rooms for your event. You can assign booked rooms to conferences, lectures, meetings, sessions, contributions or breaks. Recurring bookings, e.g. Daily , Weekly , Monthly . Email notifications (to users and room managers, about every important action).
